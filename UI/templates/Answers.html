        <p><strong>How do you unstage all commits using the terminal?</strong></p>
        <p>I accidentally added a lot of temporary files using git add -A. I managed to unstage the files using the following commands and managed to remove the dirty index.</p>
        <p>git ls-files -z | xargs -0 rm -f</p>
        <p>diff --name-only --diff-filter=D -z | xargs -0 git rm --cached</p> 
        <p>The above commands are listed in the git help rm. But sadly, my files were also deleted on execution, even though I had given cache option. How can I clear the index without losing the content? Also it would be helpful if someone can explain the way this pipe operation works.</p>

        <p>I'm afraid that the first of those command lines unconditionally deleted from the working copy all the files that are in git's staging area. The second one unstaged all the files that were tracked but have now been deleted. Unfortunately this means that you will have lost any uncommitted modifications to those files. If you want to get your working copy and index back to how they were at the last commit, you can (carefully) use the following command:</p>
        <form>
            <button type="submit">Up-vote</button>
            <button type="submit">Down-vote</button>
            <button type="submit">Accept</button>
