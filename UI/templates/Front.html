            <p>How do you unstage all commits using the terminal?</p>
            <p>I accidentally added a lot of temporary files using git add -A.</p>
            <p>I managed to unstage the files using the following commands and managed to remove the dirty index.</p>
            <p>git ls-files -z | xargs -0 rm -f</p>
            <p>diff --name-only --diff-filter=D -z | xargs -0 git rm --cached</p> 
            <p>The above commands are listed in the git help rm. But sadly, my files were also deleted on execution, even though I had given cache option. How can I clear the index without losing the content? Also it would be helpful if someone can explain the way this pipe operation works.</p>
